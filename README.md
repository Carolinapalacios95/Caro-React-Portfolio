## Description
    
This is a React application that showcases an About Me, Contact Form, and Resume section, as well as a Portfolio section with projects that I have completed throughout the UNC Bootcamp Full-Stack Developing course. 

## Built-With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
